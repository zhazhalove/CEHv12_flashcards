      "Front": "What is NetBIOS?",
      "Back": "NetBIOS is a Windows service used for file and printer sharing. It allows computers to have a NetBIOS name and was initially an alternative to DNS. The nbtstat command can be used on Windows to gather information about local or remote machines."
    },
    {
      "Front": "What is the command to check NetBIOS on Windows?",
      "Back": "The nbtstat command is used to check NetBIOS on Windows. It can show the remote machine's name table with the -a option followed by the name, or the -A option followed by an IP address. It can also show the cache with -c, or local names with -n."

      "Front": "What tool is used to check NetBIOS on Linux?",
      "Back": "nbtscan is a Linux tool used for similar purposes as nbtstat on Windows. The -r option can be used followed by an IP address to get information. The -v option increases the verbosity of the output."

      "Front": "What is SMB?",
      "Back": "SMB (Server Message Block) is used for file sharing, similar to NetBIOS. It utilizes UDP ports 137 and 138, and TCP ports 137 and 139. Nmap can be used to enumerate SMB by using the -A option."

    {
      "Front": "How can nmap be used for SMB enumeration?",
      "Back": "nmap can enumerate SMB with the -A option, which includes OS and versioning along with running scripts. The command sudo nmap -A -T5 -n -p 445 192.168.202.200 can be used to scan for SMB."
